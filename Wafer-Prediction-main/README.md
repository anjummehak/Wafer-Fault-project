# Wafer-Fault-Detection
Semiconductor wafers serve as the foundational building blocks for the creation of integrated circuits (ICs), which are integral to virtually all modern electronic devices. A waferâ€™s quality is crucial as defects or faults in these wafers can lead to catastrophic failures in electronic systems. The detection of faulty wafers during manufacturing is essential to ensure the reliability and performance of the final product. To address this challenge, we propose a Wafer Fault Detection system using machine learning, which leverages data from multiple sensors to classify wafers as either "Good" or "Bad." In this project, we handle a dataset containing sensor measurements for each wafer, with a binary label indicating the wafer's status. The dataset is large, spanning multiple files, and comes with challenges such as missing values, inconsistent data formats, and potentially irrelevant features. The project aims to build an efficient system that not only cleans and validates the data but also builds a robust predictive model capable of determining wafer quality based on historical sensor readings.
